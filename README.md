# Password-strength-checker
Password Strength Checker (Python)

A lightweight and efficient Python tool that analyzes password complexity and provides actionable feedback on strength, entropy, and security posture. It helps users and developers enforce strong password policies by detecting weak patterns, reused sequences, and common vulnerabilities.

**üîç Features:**

Evaluates password strength based on length, entropy, and character diversity

Detects weak patterns, dictionary words, and sequential characters

Provides real-time feedback and security recommendations

Supports custom policy configuration (minimum length, special chars, etc.)

Clean, modular Python code for easy integration with web apps or CLI tools

**üí° Use Cases:**

Integrate with registration or authentication systems

Use in security awareness tools or password hygiene checks

Educate users about safe password creation practices

**Requirements**

```Python 3.x```



**INSTALLATION**

Clone the repository:

```# git clone https://github.com/shivangi-goel-82/Password-strength-checker-.git```

```# cd password-strength-checker.py```

```# python password-strength-checker.py```
